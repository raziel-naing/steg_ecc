# steg_ecc

This project is created as a term project of Advanced Information Security class at 2019 Spring Semester.

Introduction
Conventional steganography tools use AES for encryption. In this project, we create new algorithm by taking the advantage of public key (ECC) to achieve more secure and easy key distribution.

Two main contributors of the project are YEONG HUN SHIN and YE NAING.

The following are the contact information of the contributors.
