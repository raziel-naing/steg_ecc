# New Steganography alogorithm using ECC

This project is created as a term project of Advanced Information Security class at 2019 Spring Semester.

# Project Description
Conventional steganography tools use AES for encryption. In this project, we create new algorithm by taking the advantage of public key (ECC) to achieve more secure and easy key distribution. We use Python for the implementation of our project.
